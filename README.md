### Introduction

I can introduce myself as a programmer and a game developer. I had a passion for programming and I was hooked. I came into this thinking I knew quite 
a bit when it came to programming. I found out early on that the knowledge I came in with was just tip of the iceberg.  I was always looking for ways 
to improve my skills and I was always looking for ways to learn new things. I have always played video games but looked at it as a hobby. Never did I 
imagined myself as a actual game developer. Now I get to make my hobby a career and with it enter a new world of programming.

### The Project
This project is a Unity project that I created to navigate through a VR scene. It goes through the basics of VR and how to use it. You are able to pick items up and move them around.As well as interact with objects, such as the door and the projector. You are able to move around the room and look around, as well as teleport to different rooms.

### Features that still need to be implemented
I have not implemented a multi-step interaction yet. For example if I place a code or do steps in a specific order, then the door will not open.
